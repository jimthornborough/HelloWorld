# HelloWorld

## Getting started

The HelloWorld program consists of a Console application and a Web API server. 
To run the application, start the API server and then run the Console application.

To change the message output location, use the WriterTypeID setting in the App.config file. Use a value of 1 to write the message to the Console, use 2 to write the message to the API (Database).

To add database functionality to the program, complete the SaveMessage method in the HelloWorld controller in the HelloWorld.API project.
